# PicoOs
**PicoOS is Operating System (OS) intended for Raspberry Pi Pico**

**This OS is intended to be my study platform.** <p>
<p>
Planning / Objectives:<p>
* At first, the scheduler should be of the cooperative type, but as I advance in my studies, I want the scheduler to have context-switching functions and become preemptive.
* Create device manager.<p>
* Develop process management mechanisms such as:<p>
-- Message exchange between processes,<p>
-- Semaphore, <p>
-- Mutex, <p>
-- Event manager <p>
<p>
