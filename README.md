# PicoOs
**PicoOS is Operating System (OS) intended for Raspberry Pi Pico**
<hr></hr>
This OS is intended to be my study platform. <p>
<p>
Planning / Objectives:<p>
  
- At first, the scheduler should be of the cooperative type, 
- but as I advance in my studies,
- I want the scheduler to have context-switching functions and become preemptive. 
- Create device manager. 
- Develop process management mechanisms such as:
  - Message exchange between processes,
  - Semaphore, 
  - Mutex,
  - Event manager
