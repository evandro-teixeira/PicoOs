# PicoOs
**PicoOS is Operating System (OS) intended for Raspberry Pi Pico**

**This OS is intended to be my study platform.** <p>
<p>
Planning / Objectives:<p>
- At first, the scheduler should be of the cooperative type, </p>
- but as I advance in my studies, </p>
- I want the scheduler to have context-switching functions and become preemptive. </p>
- Create device manager.</p>
- Develop process management mechanisms such as: </p>
-- Message exchange between processes, </p>
-- Semaphore, </p>
-- Mutex, </p>
-- Event manager </p>
